Setting up security to push my files from git to github

  git remote add origin https://github.com/OT-Coyote/cpp-version4-c11.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main


Solution:
https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/blob/main/docs/credstores.md
git config --global credential.credentialStore cache
A browser popped up, I had to login with my browser


To get github to work I need to use a Credential Manager

This is the best soluttion
